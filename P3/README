This is as far as I go with the project 3 for the moment.
Still was not able to get the test 6 working on my machine
but I included it in me gtest in case it can work on the 
other machine.

The heap file generation was not included, need to be
generated at you end. 

And I have changed test.cat for it to fit on my machine,
replace it then test.

The Pictures of test 1 - 5 is in pic directory
(Just ignore some messsages I set for debug propose)

Thank you!
